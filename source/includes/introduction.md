# Introduction

Garuda Robotics provides a suite of APIs that extend the Garuda Plex Platform, allowing you to create your own proprietary applications to address a variety of drone use cases. The APIs are available for the entire lifecycle of drone operations, from **pre-flight planning**, to **live flights**, to **post-flight analytics**.
